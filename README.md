The game utilizes a timer and an accuracy function to assess the user's typing speed. As the user types, the timer starts, measuring how long it takes to complete the typing task. Additionally, a function tracks any inaccuracies made during typing, which are factored into the overall typing speed calculation. At the end of the game, the user receives their typing speed score, which considers both accuracy and speed.
